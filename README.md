## How to Submit a Correction

First of all, thank you for your interest in helping with translations!

**The best way to submit a correction/suggestion is to simply create a PR with your changes.**

Please note:

1. All work is located in the `next` branch.
1. Misspelling corrections are very welcome.
1. Phrase changes should be about better phrasing, not a complete re-write of text.
1. Please do not add or remove sentences.
1. More PRs is better than less. Each change will be reviewed, so it's easier for us to merge them one by one.
1. If PRs are accepted, they will **not** automatically appear on the website; however, they'll be pushed manually ASAP.
1. If you'd like to request a new language, feel free to open an issue. Providing text for that language is optional.
